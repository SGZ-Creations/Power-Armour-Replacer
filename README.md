# Factorio mod Power-Armour-Replacer 
Currently in BETA!

# Main description and goal:
The goal on this mod was to make the players able to add this mod to there on-going game and let the mod take care of migrating the other mods Armours & Equipment's. To one mod's,  Armours & Equipment's. Maybe even make it possible to remove the others, but importantly clean up the crafting tab from say 4 different armour mods. in to 1. Tho due to API limits. That was sadly not fully possible. So things here have been hidden and disabled instead. Still clean up the crafting menu. Still not migrating the other mods Armours and Equipment's. unless the API make it become a possibility. At a later stage if ever.

# Adds New:
Armours, Exo-Skeletons, Personal Laser, Personal Solar, Shields, Portable Fusion Reactors, Roboports, Batteries, NVG's, Belt-immunity And Achievements to play along with.

The mod has some compatibility included and still being worked on but I was so eager to let players get there hands on the mod before all this is done as it will take a lot of time to complete.
