par_cas-info=CAS is requires by PA&R, this is done so that the host can adjust settings, should the armour grids and/or INV-Bonus be to big.\nImage: shows the default Vanilla & [space-age] setting alternatives.\nWhile CAS has more mods supported the settings will only apear if the mod is added and PA&R is not disabling them.\n\nWIP(Move this to CAS mod) and make alternative code


par_info=Power Armour & Replacer aka:(PA&R) works in vanilla but was not intended with vanilla, tho are still playable.\n\nPA&R provides Armours & Equipment that is meant to be OP, & meant to be played along with other overhaul mods. Meaning if u play in vanilla, The mod will make you Over-OP.\n\nAll equipment(s) stats will stay as is & are not changeable(4 now?), Since the mod is balanced within itself, high cost is to be expected.\n\nStill should you wish to change how things are CAS(CA&S) will allow you to tweak and alter PA&R Armour(s) grids and INV-Bonuses if they are to big for your likings.\n\nCAS is required by PA&R so it should be in your mod list, to allow for easy tweaking.\nTHANKS A LOT FOR READING THIS.
