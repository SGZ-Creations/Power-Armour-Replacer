power-armour-replacer=Thanks for using Power Armour & Replacer.\n\n\nGraphics for Armour 6-10 & 4-5 new Discharge defence textures would bee apriciated if you are willing to volunteer & your thanks wil be listed in the mods Credits page.


par_info=Power Armour & Replacer aka:(PA&R) Works in vanilla but was not intended with vanilla. Tho are still playable.\n\nPA&R provides Armours & Equipment that is now changable with the newely provided setting to make it work your way. Still meant to be played along with other overhaul mods in regards to recipes default PAR mod settings. Meaning if u play in vanilla, The mod will make you Over Powered witout tweaks & cost lot less due to limited items in game.(Space age does help with that a bit)\n\nAll Armour Resistance stats will stay as is & are not changeable on my acord 4 ever(other mods are Welcome to make settings for them), Since the mod is purpsely made OP. high cost is to be expected.\n\nStill should you wish to change how things are  CAS(CA&S) will allow you to tweak and alter PA&R Armour(s) grids and INV-Bonuses if they are to big for your likings.\n\nCAS is required by PA&R so it should be in your mod list, to allow for easy tweaking.\nTHANKS A LOT FOR READING THIS.
