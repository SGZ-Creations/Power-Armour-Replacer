par-nightvision-mk1=The first set of vision where made with bad componets & there for having isuess working at night due to it's 75% darkness reqirement why that is are unknow. Still 25% more than the rentals which a smart guy dcided to put in the recyclcer. Just don't let the owner know about the recyclcing of his NVG's.

par-nightvision-mk2=The second version we decided to improve on power, compared to the first model which some how uses 125GW how we made that hppen we will never know. tho at least we don't use the same parts here but took the old model and tried improving it, Which suceeded with power down and only 35% darkness is reqired for them to activate. still some of the parts on the old one caused a lot of power needs. semingly made it have bettere activation conditions.
